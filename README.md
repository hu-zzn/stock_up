🛒 Ration App



📱 Overview

Ration App is a smart household checklist app that helps users quickly create and manage their monthly grocery (ration) lists.  

Instead of searching for items one by one, users can browse through predefined categories (e.g., Grains, Spices, Oils, Dairy, etc.), tick the items they need, and instantly generate a complete shopping list — ready to be shared via WhatsApp.



The goal is to make ration planning faster, easier, and more complete, ensuring no essential items are missed while ordering or shopping.



✨ Key Features

\- ✅ Predefined Item Lists: Organized under categories like grains, pulses, spices, oils, dairy, cleaning, etc.  

\- 🧾 Smart Checklist Interface: Tap to select or deselect items, add quantity and brand details.
